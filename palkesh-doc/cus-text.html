Hello Sir,

Store Name - ARTISANE

Theme Name - Copy of Final - Dev Work[ps-23-08-2023]

Preview Link - https://artisane-nyc.com/?_ab=0&_fd=0&_sc=1&preview_theme_id=133016715450

I have updated the permissions/access for you on Shopify.

1. I would like to have a sticky menu with hamburger example site below;https://abettersource.org/

Reply : Done. 

2. Access done. Feedback; Could you leave just the first sentence under the title of the kit and remove the text under to include the text in the 3 sections under so it will bring up the ADD TO CART button because it is too low on the page. Also make the ADD TO CART button more visible. (color) 

2 x 100% natural coconut wax bloc2 x pre-sized bottles of 2 different phthalates free fragrances 2 x 100% cotton wicks 2 x wooden wick holders 2 x seamless metal tins (8oz) 2 x top labels 2 x warning labels  Add this in  "What's inside?" 
______
2 x pots of different sizes a wooden spoon or stick to stir a timera thermometer REMOVE LINKa pair of scissor paper towels This should be in "What else do I need from home?" ("I" and not "i")_______ For "How do I use it?": it should say;
Sign-up for Artisane candle making digital course and learn how to make candles with healthy ingredients using your kit. Learn more. 
Sign up link;https://sso.teachable.com/secu ... /candle-making-class
Learn more link;https://artisane-nyc.com/pages/sales-masterclass

Reply : Done. 

I will change the pictures for landscape format and will send you updated pictures ASAP. 

Reply : Ok. 

3. OK. A few changes;The name of the product should be "Candle Making Course", the price should be $84, the button should say SIGN UP NOW (is it possible to make the font bold for the button to be a bit more visible?) and the link for the button (checkout) should be this;https://sso.teachable.com/secu ... /candle-making-class

Reply : Done. See screenshot - 

https://prnt.sc/gccsqihB64s0

For the menu, please make sure that I can modify it myself on shopify because I can update it with the one I have now. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks

Reply : Yes, you can update menu from shopify store. See screenshots -

https://prnt.sc/51CrT2MHyXLe

https://prnt.sc/wjSqz-J41RFo

These 2 pictures are for the candle kit product page, what's inside 
candle kit inside pic 1.png
candle kit inside pic 2.png

Reply : Done.

---------------------------------

2- Product page Candle KIT + subscription option 
  Design or modify the current product page for candle making kit (see template provided) 
  2 payment options; 1 pay one time for $44 and 2 a subscription option for less. 
  (see on the template provided) 
 ------ Ok, I will configure both apps. 
 i)for the subscription part, we will probably need to add an app such as “subify” to add the subscription system 
 App Url: https://apps.shopify.com/subify-subscriptions
 
Reply : We have integrate the "Subify Subscriptions app". Its shows when publish/live the working theme.

Thank you
